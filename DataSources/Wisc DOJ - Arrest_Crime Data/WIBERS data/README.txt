"The violation of laws prohibiting the production, distribution, and/or use of certain controlled
substances. The unlawful cultivation, manufacture, distribution, sale, purchase, use, possession,
transportation, or importation of any controlled drug or narcotic substance. Arrests for violations
of state and local laws, specifically those relating to the unlawful possession, sale, use, growing,
manufacturing, and making of narcotic drugs.
The UCR Program collects information on arrests for drug abuse violations based on the
narcotics involved. Agencies include all arrests for violations, including attempts, and subdivide
the arrests by differentiating between Sale/Manufacturing and Possession:
Sale/Manufacturing
a. Opium or cocaine and their derivatives (morphine, heroin, codeine)
b. Marijuana
c. Synthetic narcotics—manufactured narcotics which can cause true drug addiction
(demerol, methadones)
d. Dangerous nonnarcotic drugs (barbiturates, benzedrine)
Possession  "

Note: Only agencies in jurisdictions where the possession of Spice, also known as K2, is illegal
should report offenses and/or arrests for the drug. Spice is a synthetic, cannabinoid herbal
substance that, when smoked, produces a Marijuana-like high. However, agencies should not
classify Spice as Marijuana for crime reporting purposes. Because it has been known to cause
hallucinations in some users, the Chemical Unit at the FBI’s Laboratory has advised that
agencies should report the drugs as K = Other Hallucinogens. "
